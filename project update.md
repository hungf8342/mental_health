## update

1. We have obtained all the data we need.

2. Since gtrendsR only provides search term data by city, we need to group the mental health facilities data by those locations. During our session with the library's GIS specialist Warren, he showed us how to access the facilities (and demographic) data within esri. If we decide to use the esri data for mapping mental health facilities, we will likely play around with the available options for data selection. If we proceed with the mental health facilities data we obtained from California Health and Human Services Agency, we will likely do some data wrangling using the geographic information. 

3. The out-of-syllabus elements are GIS mapping (for illustrating mental health services supply and demand) and logistic regression (for predicting suicide rates).

## prof hardin comments on update

seems like you sort of have the data you need, and you sort of still need to get data with GIS.  learning GIS and creating a new dataset is definitely sufficient for the project.  in fact, that seems totally awesome.  however, i'm happy for you also to do logistic regression.

please let me know if/when you have questions.  i love that you used your resources and reached out to someone at the library who can help you make this project awesome.  nice work!!
